# Unsupervised Learning for Productivity Garment Employees

The apparel industry is one of the most profitable industries worldwide. Until the end of the 1970s, companies engaged in the apparel business produced clothing in Europe and North America. These production units performed all the steps for manufacturing clothes, from cutting the fabric to finishing. Many workers were hired for production, and the companies were responsible for their wages, social security, and working conditions. Regardless of the market globalization and the international demand, the industry relies on human capital (employees) to ensure product effectiveness and efficiency and to achieve industrial objectives. Because of the dependence on manual labor, the production of a garment company depends on the productivity of employees working in various departments of the company. When employees do not meet the company's management objectives, some of the links in the production chain fail, thereby negatively affecting the quality and efficiency of the company. By analyzing data from a major garment company in Bangladesh, we created a predictive model for employee productivity in terms of various variables involved in the employee labor process. Data mining was used for data manipulation and cleaning, whereas random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting were applied for predictability estimates. The extreme gradient boosting model proved to be the most efficient in predicting employee productivity with a mean absolute error of 0.0174, root mean square error of 0.0497, mean absolute percentage error of 2.6602, correlation coefficient of 0.96 and Accuracy(\%) of 97.34, between original and predicted data. These values are considerably lower than those previously reported in the literature. The proposed model is an important tool for decision makers to evaluate the actions to be taken by a company for profit maximization when certain variables are known to yield a certain performance.


## Data declaration:
For the following work we have used the dataset called garments worker productivity, which has been originally constructed from a survey conducted by the engineering department of a major garment company in Bangladesh. Principal reference for this dataset can be found in [1, 2] and also is available from UCI Machine Learning (Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems) repository at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees. This dataset includes important attributes of garment manufacturing process and employee productivity, which have been collected manually and validated by the industry experts.
